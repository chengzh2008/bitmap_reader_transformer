# Bitmap Reader and Transformer
====================================
For this assignment you will be building a Bitmap reader and transformer. It will read a Bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on the bitmap and then write it out to a new file. This project will require the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. Your project should include tests, as well as a Gruntfile and package.json file. Make sure to run all your code through jshint and jscs.
